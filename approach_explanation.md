# Document Intelligence System: Approach Explanation

## Overview

Our document intelligence system extracts and prioritizes the most relevant sections from a collection of documents based on a specific persona and their job-to-be-done. The system is designed to be efficient, running on CPU only with a processing time of less than 60 seconds for 3-5 documents, while maintaining a model size under 1GB.

## Methodology

### PDF Text Extraction

The system begins by extracting text from PDF documents using PyPDF2, preserving page numbers and document structure. This approach allows us to maintain the context of the extracted text, which is crucial for accurate section identification and relevance ranking. We implemented preprocessing techniques to clean and normalize the extracted text, handling common issues like inconsistent spacing and line breaks.

### Section Identification

We employ a rule-based approach combined with heuristics to identify sections and subsections within the extracted text. The system recognizes section titles based on formatting patterns (e.g., capitalization, numbering) and content indicators. This approach is more efficient than deep learning models while still providing accurate section boundaries. Each identified section is associated with its document source, page number, and content, creating a structured representation of the document collection.

### Relevance Ranking

The core of our system is the relevance ranking module, which determines the importance of each section based on the persona and job-to-be-done. We use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to represent sections as numerical vectors, capturing the significance of terms within each section relative to the entire document collection. 

Cosine similarity is then calculated between each section vector and a query vector derived from the persona and job description. This approach effectively measures the semantic relevance of sections to the user's needs. We enhance this basic ranking with additional heuristics:

1. Boosting scores for sections with titles containing key terms from the persona or job
2. Adjusting scores based on content length and position in the document
3. Applying domain-specific weighting for different types of content

### Subsection Analysis

For the top-ranked sections, we perform a more detailed analysis to extract the most relevant subsections. This process involves breaking down the section content into smaller units and applying the same relevance ranking approach at a finer granularity. The result is a set of refined text snippets that directly address the user's needs.

### Performance Optimization

To meet the performance constraints, we implemented several optimizations:

1. Using lightweight, CPU-friendly algorithms instead of resource-intensive deep learning models
2. Implementing efficient text processing with minimal dependencies
3. Optimizing the vectorization process to handle only the most informative terms
4. Employing lazy loading of document content to reduce memory usage

## Technical Implementation

The system is implemented as a modular Python application with the following components:

1. `pdf_extractor.py`: Handles PDF text extraction with page preservation
2. `section_processor.py`: Identifies and processes sections and subsections
3. `relevance_ranker.py`: Ranks sections by relevance to the persona and job
4. `output_generator.py`: Generates the final JSON output
5. `main.py`: Orchestrates the entire process

The application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run in various environments without internet access. The entire system operates within the specified constraints while providing high-quality, relevant results tailored to the user's specific needs.
